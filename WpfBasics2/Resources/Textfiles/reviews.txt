0[(*^s3p4r4t0r^*)]Xuan Yi[(*^s3p4r4t0r^*)]It was very good, the tour guide Ash was very knowledgable and professional and would go out of his way to ensure our satisfaction. The food was surprisingly salty, but I enjoyed it very much as it reminded me of my mother's cooking. My only complaint is that I wish it lasted longer. Would recommend![(*^s3p4r4t0r^*)]28/12/2017 10:20:12 AM
